This project is a simple responsive blog layout built using Bootstrap.

## Features

1. **Bootstrap Integration**  
   Included Bootstrap CSS and JS via CDN in `index.html`.

2. **Responsive Navbar**  
   Added a navigation bar with brand name and links using Bootstrap's navbar classes.

   Each card includes:
   - An image
   - Title
   - Short description
   - "Read More" button

4. **Responsive Grid**  
   Used Bootstrapâ€™s grid system to arrange the cards responsively across various screen sizes.

5. **Footer with Social Icons**  
   Added a footer containing social media icons using Bootstrap classes and optionally Font Awesome.

6. **Styling and Spacing**  
   Customized the look using Bootstrap utility classes for spacing (`p-3`, `m-2`, etc.) and color.

7. **Responsiveness Tested**  
   Tested layout across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure a consistent look.
